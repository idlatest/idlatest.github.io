Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning
journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

### Lists 1

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my
   online accounts.


### Lists 2

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro`
   files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

### Lists 3

#### Another heading

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and
   Markdown posts!

## What's next

> codeblog codeblog codeblog

hello world

:joy:

### Code sample

```ts {1-2} ins={5} del={6} title="example.js"
const func = function (x, y) {
  return x + y;
};

console.log(func());
console.log("hello world");
```

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this
space for more to come.
